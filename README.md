## Learning GO

In some cases I write some scripts to do some maintenance tasks for myself, usually I write those in bash or Python.
Now I've decided every now and then whenever I need a tool I'll write it in go, so I get to learn a new language.

I like the fact that it's easy to distribute and compiled to native.
